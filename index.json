A faster healing time can be achieved using our method than conventional scratching. Wound’s geometry and shape can influence healing speed and rate. Permanent magnets were successfully coated by PDA, and characterized by SEM and FT-IR. The cell viability is not adversely affected after microrobotic scratching.","tags":[],"title":"Microfluidic wound scratching platform based on an untethered microrobot with magnetic actuation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdurrahim Yilmaz","Fatih Goktay","Rahmetullah Varol","Gulsum Gencoglan","Huseyin Uvet"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1657843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657843200,"objectID":"f2591702a6ec3b290db26d7a12a61b2f","permalink":"https://abdurrahimyilmaz.github.io/publication/onychomycosis/","publishdate":"2022-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/onychomycosis/","section":"publication","summary":"160 microscopic full field photographs containing the fungal element, obtained from patients with onychomycosis, and 297 microscopic full field photographs containing dissolved keratin obtained from normal nails were collected.

In order to detect fungus and keratin, VGG16 and InceptionV3 models were developed by the use of these patches. The diagnostic performance of models was compared with 16 dermatologists by using 200 test patches.","tags":[],"title":"Deep convolutional neural networks for onychomycosis detection using microscopic images with KOH examination","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Objective:\nMy objective:\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://abdurrahimyilmaz.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Example Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://abdurrahimyilmaz.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"}]
